# Terraform Registry

The Terraform Registry is a repository of reusable Terraform modules shared by the community. It's a great resource for finding, using, and publishing Terraform modules.

## Public Registry for Modules

The Terraform Registry is publicly accessible and includes a vast number of modules for various providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. These modules are written by the community and shared for public use.

## Verified Modules from Providers

The Registry includes a number of verified modules from providers. These modules are officially maintained and verified by HashiCorp, the company behind Terraform.

## Community Modules

In addition to the verified modules, the Registry also includes countless modules contributed by the community. These modules can be used as-is or can be forked and modified for your own use.

## Module Versioning

The Terraform Registry supports semantic versioning, allowing you to pin your module usage to a specific version and avoid breaking changes.

## Module Documentation

Each module in the Registry includes documentation describing its use and requirements. This makes it easy to understand what a module does and how to use it.
