### Terraform Learning Notes
This repository contains my personal notes and code snippets from learning [Terraform], an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code. Terraform can be used to manage cloud services, virtual machines, network devices, and more.

### Why Terraform?
I decided to learn Terraform because I wanted to:
- Automate and simplify the creation and configuration of cloud resources
- Improve the reliability and reproducibility of my infrastructure deployments
- Use a declarative and human-readable language to describe my desired state
- Apply the best practices of infrastructure as code, such as version control, modularity, and testing

### Whatâ€™s in this repository?
This repository contains the following files:

`notes`: This page contains my notes on various topics related to Terraform, such as installation, syntax, commands, providers, modules, state, variables, outputs, etc. The notes are written in Markdown format and organized by chapters.

### How to use this repository?
You can use this repository as a reference or a guide for your own learning journey with Terraform. You can also clone or fork this repository and modify it according to your needs. To run the code examples, you will need to have Terraform installed on your machine and configure the appropriate providers for your cloud services. You can find more details on how to do that in the notes.

Keep learning!
