# Terraform State

In Terraform, the "state" is a crucial component that keeps track of the resources it manages. After creating resources, Terraform saves a JSON-formatted map of the resources in the `terraform.tfstate` file.

## Local State

By default, Terraform stores the state locally in a file named `terraform.tfstate`. When running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`, Terraform will detect the difference between the last-known state and the current state. To force Terraform not to refresh the state, you can use the `-refresh=false` option.

```bash
terraform apply -refresh=false
```

## Remote State

For team-based workflows, it is recommended to use a `shared remote state`. This allows for better collaboration and prevents any conflicts in the state. Remote state is stored on a remote data store (like AWS S3, GCS, etc.) and includes features like state locking and encryption.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure Terraform to store the state in an S3 bucket and use a DynamoDB table for state locking:

`main.tf`
```yml
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = "/root/pets/txt"
    content = "List of pets"
}
```

`terraform.tf`
```yml
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = "unique-bucket-name"
        key = "test/terraform.tfstate"
        region = "us-west-1"
        dynamodb_table = "state-locking"
    }
}
```

## Terraform State Commands

Terraform provides several commands to manage and inspect the state:

- `terraform state list`: List resources in the state.
- `terraform state mv`: Move an item in the state.
- `terraform state pull`: Manually download and output the state from remote state.
- `terraform state push`: Manually upload a local state file to remote state.
- `terraform state rm`: Remove items from the state.
- `terraform state show`: Show a resource in the state.

You can also use `jq` to query the state in JSON format:

```bash
terraform state pull | jq '.resources[] | select(.name == "state-locking-db")|.instances[].attributes.hash_key'
```
